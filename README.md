## Liquid
Liquid is a Bitcoin sidechain built using the open-source Elements software. Liquid uses a federated consensus model which allows for rapid settlement of both Bitcoin and Issued Assets. Liquid also utilizes Confidential Transactions, which allows the asset amount and type to be hidden from any actors not directly involved in the transaction. Liquid also provides the ability to reveal any of this information to select third parties, such as auditors and regulators.

When managed through Liquid Securities, those assets can represent the tokenized, digital form of traditional securities.

##Liquid Securities
Liquid Securities is currently available as an API. The API allows Liquid Securities to be integrated into an existing token platform, providing an easy way to expose end users to the asset capabilities of the Liquid Network.
